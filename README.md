# Unreal Tournament 2004 Explosive Ammo Mutator
An Explosive Ammo mutator for Unreal Tournament 2004.

This is not a buildable project. It represents the remaining creative output of an old project
created by [Chris Schultz](https://github.com/ChristopherSchultz) and myself for our own amusment.
It is published here for posterity and for any public good that may come of it. More information about
the specifics may be found [on my personal site](https://ardvaark.net/projects/mutator.html).
